Absolutely minimal setup for evolution of Sun-like star in MESA r22.11.1
starting with homogeneous cloud of H/He ending with cooling white dwarf.

To run stellar evolution, first compile "star" code

./mk

and run from the beginning:

./rn


Entire evolution should take ~14000 steps and from 70 minutes (high-end CPU) to several (~5h on 4-core VM) hours.   New dirs will be created
png/    -- a lot of visualization
LOGS/   -- evolution data
photos/ -- restart "photos"

To create ALL movies from PNG's use provided script (MEncoder required) :

./parallel_movie_encode.sh

Changelog

2022-12-18: Previous version stopped due to misspelled triple-alpha reaction, which was finally corrected.
The only change reqired is to edit file history_columns.list:

tri_alfa -> tri_alpha

Above change is required for Power plot to show energy from He burning.
